# Implementation Summary: Image Alignment and UI Improvements

## Overview

This PR implements comprehensive improvements to the eCertificate generation system, addressing alignment verification issues and adding extensive UI enhancements for better user experience.

## Problem Statements Addressed

1. No confirmation for email sending status
2. No proper waiting window for users during generation
3. No view/download options after generation
4. No detailed status of certificate generation
